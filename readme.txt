Here are the files you may need. Login.aspx is the main login page. Login.ascx is the usercontrol referenced by Login.aspx. FacebookLogin is a user control referenced by Login.ascx. 

Would you like us to send you the new header also?

We may need a new masterpage that is responsive that the login.aspx page sits in but not sure if we need that or not but wanted to mention it so you can keep it in mind in case we need that.

Let us know if you need anything else.
